Steps and directions for data management
---

**Goal**: Have comparable data across each different study site

Ideally, I think we would like to have three datatables in our database

1. The GPS datatable: Will contain all of the GPS tracking data 

| pigID | CollarNumber | Study | LMT_time | LMT_date | lat | long | DOP |

- All date and times should be in the same format
- All locations should be lats and longs


2. Pig attributes: Will contain attributes of each pig in the study

| pigID | Study | weight | sex | other |

3. Study site attributes: Will contain attributes of the specific study

| Study | Extent | Duration | meanLat| meanLong | 


These could be stored as separate csv's but ideally they would be SQLlite datatables, so we didn't always have to have all of the data in memory.

Once we have made this data, we can decide on raster layers.  Each row in the GPS datatable can then be associated with a raster value from the particular layer(s) that we are interested.  Some examples include

1. Crop layers from CropScape
2. Landscape cover data from USDA landcover data
3. Temperature data at as close as possible to the location of each GPS collar.
4. Distance to the nearest road
5. Distance to the nearest water source
6. Others
