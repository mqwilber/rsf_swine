## Meeting with Shannon Kay on 1/15/2018

Open challenges with serology model
----

1. Capturing the endemic dynamics.  Current model wasn't doing a good job capturing the peaks in the endemic infections.
	- Suggestions:  Sample the data longitudinally.
2. Pig data:  See the Sun et al. paper in the the docs folder.  Some concerns about the quality of this data for applying it to the serology model.
	- Contact Carrie Pederson about the field portion of the pig data.
3. Some assumptions that could be tested
	- Assuming independence in the anitbody function over time
	- Correlation structure in the antibody curve
	- Differing variance across the curve
	- The seropositive cutoff is not being inferred from the data.  Trying setting this as a random variable.
	- TSI as a continuous variable
	- Using both titer data and antibody data

Other datasets
----

1. Rabbit dataset for endemic dynamics (Toni Peacock)
2. Rabies dataset (Amy (not amy davis))
3. Avian influenza with Susan Shriner

Helpful contacts/resources
-----
1. Fran Buderman (post-doc at CSU)
2. Mevin Hooten (pretty busy guy, prof. at CSU)
3. Ander Wilson (Bayesian stats prof at CSU)
4. Jenifer Hoeding (Stats prof at CSU)
5. Hank Ephraim might have a stats package for fitting continuous time models
