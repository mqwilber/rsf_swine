## RSF analysis notes and reading

### Goals for the the next two weeks

a. Read up on the RSF literature and identify potential methodological approaches that could be useful
b. Read up on RSF data on pig populations
c. Familiarize myself with data that is currently available

Methodological approaches for RSF analysis
-------------------------------------------

## Methodological questions

1. Do the approaches provide different results when looking at the RSF for pigs? 

2. Will incorporating random effects of individuals improve predictive estimates?
	- Others have included random effects (Northrup)

3. The real key 

3. Using this big data set to validate and PREDICT RSF functions on left out pigs.  Playing with model validation of RSF functions.

## Some potentially interesting approaches

1. Hooten et al. 2014, Statistical Methodology
	- Uses a Continuous time Correlated random walk model for animal movement model animal movement and then conditions on this movement model when estimating the RSF function. 
	- Good for GPS data collected on short intervals. 
	- Can impute over missing time intervals.
2. Nielsen and Sawyer, 2013, Ecology and Evolution
	- This approach seems very straightforward.  Using negative binomial regression to estimate the resource selection function when there are multiple movement points. 
	- Again, this is useful for GPS data where there are many points from the same individual.
3. Hanks et al. 2011 Plos One
	- A velocity-based approach for movement.  The approach relies on modeling how an animal moves over a resource gradient.  To they move to gradients and what is their speed when they hit a certain gradient.
	- I like this approach because it seems be reflecting animal movement a bit better than simply location data.
	- Also this approach makes it easy to impute over unequal time intervals/missing values.
4. Northrup et al. 2016, Ecological Applications
	- Uses the Hooten implementation.  Pretty cool approach I think.
5. Wilson et al. 2018 and Hooten et al. 2015
	- Again, using the CTCRW but also layering in a Markov model with umps between grids that depend on resource and covariates. Can include directional covariates as well as locations based depending on the scale of the data.  I like this approach because the covariates are DIRECTLY affecting the animal movement.  Not just ad-hocly being used to to infer the weighted distribution (not saying this is bad and might be necessary depending on the scale of interest!).  But this approach is very appealing for telemetry data.

Notes
-------------
1. While a Bayesian approach seems like it would be for this type of analysis (random effects, imputation, etc), the size of the data might preclude a bayesian analysis. At the same time, given the size of the data, some assumption can potentially be made about the distributions that various coefficients are going to follow (i.e. MVN).
	- Update. This might not be a problem! 

2. Man, there is a lot of material on resource selection functions!  

3. Northrup et al. 2016 suggests ommited the first week of GPS data to account for potential effects of capture behavior.

4. KEY CHALLENGE: Identifying the availability sample.  Hooten et al. 2014 and Northrup et al. 2016 provide what I think is the least ad-hoc approach so far: Use a dynamic model (CTCRW) to predict for each "used" point where general radius where an animal could go next.  This defines the availability sample FOR each data point.  I like this better than trying to find the availability sample around the hull of points.  

5. THOUGHT: I don't see what advantage this would provide over the CTCRW model, but it might be possible to think about using a Gaussian process regression to help define the availability sample for each observed point.  They would be a bit more flexible...I think that would be the main advantage, but probably way slower to fit.

6. "Impossible movement criteria": Bjornerass et al. 2010.  Useful to eliminate outlying GPS data.

7. Minimum convex polygons:  A method for measuring "home range" and available space. 

8. Boyce et al. 2002:  Provides a cross validation approach for testing the efficacy of RSFs.

9. Where to get habitat layers?
	- Natural Earth
	- USDA cropland data

10. Interesting thought:  There are models that do and do not account for spatial autocorrelation in the animal data.  A few of the papers make a big deal about accounting for autcorrelation, and I tend to agree.  However, if we simulate animal movement with resource selection incorporated (need to think about how to do this...definitely not straightforward) and then ignore the autocorrelation when calculating the RSF, what happens to our resource selection functions? 
	- This could be quite a cool simulation study

11. Revisit your idea of using Gaussian process regression to account for spatial and temporal autocorrelation (or at least temporal autocorrelation), to allow for the implementation of simple cross scale models.  See Hefley et al. 2017 or discussion of using basis functions to control for spatial autocorrelation.  This could be helpful to decorrelate observed time series.


Potential covariates
--------------------

1. Pig density (location covariate)
2. Distance to roads (directional covariates)
3. Distance to crops (directional covariate and location covariates)
4. Distance to water (directional covariate)
5. Forest cover (location covariate) [Lewis et al. 2017 suggest that forest cover is important. References there in.]
6. Climate?  Though Ryan Brook said this might not be as important as we initially thought.  Most studies still include it though.


TODOS
-----

1. Identify the questions that we want to ask using RSFs?  Or, really, the questions that we want to ask in general (perhaps shouldn't be dictated by RSFs).
	- I think the primary question should be about the RSF and how the RSF varies across individuals, populations, time, and space.
	- Methdologically, I think it makes a lot of sense to use the approach of Hooten to define AV

2. Explore the CTCRW approach by Johnson for some of the pig data.  Pull in some environmental covariates and potentially try to do some fitting?

3.  COOL APPROACH:  Individual, population, and metapopulation level!  Think about a random effect of population as well as individual. We should have the data for that. It would be nice in this case to have similar covariates across populations....but we might also have different ones and that could be important too.

4. Also, think about temporal/spatial scale analysis. Similar to what we see in a couple of the analyses that I have read about. 


Questions
---------

(Trying to gear them to be useful for management)

Seems like we have a pretty good handle on what drives pig density/presence at large scales.  But at the scale of an individual, how do pigs select resources? How do pigs move on a landscape?

This could be useful for 

A) Given an introduction by a human, predicting the most likely path a pig will take and likely established home ranges given introduction at a point.

B) Establishing how pig movement differs between endemic and invading populations? Can movement patterns describe WHY they are moving northward 12 km per year?  


CHALLENGES
----------

1. Pigs show strongly daily movement patterns (i.e. they sleep probably, lol).  Need to account for these patterns if I am going to try to use a continuous time model.

2. If I want to compare pig movement across habitats
